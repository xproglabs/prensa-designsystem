# Architecture Decision Record

Date: 2023-06-10

### Status

Accepted

### Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

### Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in the following article:

http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

Looking for better context approach this project will have some customizations to last article's specs.

The root folder that stores all adr's is called "adrs".

The file pattern is built with a 3 numbers prefix that will never repeat plus adr name that must describes context for the decision record.

The final pattern folder + file looks like `/adrs/000.adr-name.md`

### Consequences

- Document architecture decisions using best practices
- Create a single source of truth regarding architecture decisions
- Create historical trace of architectural decisions
- Increase available and reliable information about the system
- Generate discussions about architecture with team mebmers and interested persons
- Create a safe space for newcomers and consistency for old-timers
